<h3>Citizenship</h3>
<p>Citizenship is being a part of a community, and having
  <br>a relationship with other people in the community.</p>

<br>

<h4>Honesty</h4>
<p>Honesty is always being truthful to people around you. Honesty is necessary
  <br> in citizenship because a society needs honesty to maintain order and civility.</p>

<h4>Compassion</h4>
<p>Compassion is showing mercy and giving help to the less fortunate
<br> Good citizens need compassion to advance other members of society.
<br> By helping other people succeed, the society as a whole succeeds. </p>

<h4>Respect</h4>
<p>Respect is an admiration for somebody based on their merits. Respect is a
<br>necessary characteristic in a good citizen, because societies have to be built
<br>off of mutual respect to preserve civil order and a good living environent.</p>



<h4>Responsibility</h4>
<p>Responsibility is "doing your job", or holding yourself accountable for your actions.
<br> A good citizen needs to be responsible doing their part in a community. If all of
<br> the people in societies do their part, the community is able to function. </p>

<h4>Courage</h4>
<p>Courage is doing something scary, but ultimately right. A good citizen needs courage in order
<br> to carry out difficult actions to help their community, such as serving in the military.</p>

<h4>Activism</h4>
<p>Activism is taking action in order to achieve change in society. I added this to the list
<br> because I believe that in order for society to improve, good citizens must press for change.</p>


<h4>One act of citizenship I perform</h4>
<p>I am part of the Student Senate at LSRHS. The Student Senate works to solve problems
  <br> on behalf of the student body. I believe that the Student Senate is a necessary part
  <br> of our school community, as it gives students a role in school government by allowing
  <br> students to elect their peers as their representatives. As a senator, I believe that
  <br> I am performing an act of citizenship to better our school as a whole.</p>
